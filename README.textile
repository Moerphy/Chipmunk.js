h1. Chipmunk.js

Chipmunk.js is a port of the "Chipmunk":http://chipmunk-physics.net/ library to Javascript. Chipmunk is a rigid body physics library in C designed for 2D games.
It's not a 1:1 port of the API, more of an OOP-Port. For instance <code>cpSpaceAddShape(space, foo)</code> in Chipmunk is <code>space.addShape(foo)</code> in Chipmunk.js.


h2. Status

Currently most of the API is ported.

Since most of the code is similiar to the original C version there still is a lot of potential (and probably need) for optimizing it for Javascript.

*It's not recommend to use Chipmunk.js yet, since it's largely untested and unstable (for instance putting components to sleep tends to run into an infinite loop) and still in a very early alpha stage!*


h2. Requirements

Until now it only requires a AMD compatible scriptloader like requireJS or curl.js.
