h1. Chipmunk.js

Chipmunk.js is a port of the Chipmunk:http://chipmunk-physics.net/ library to Javascript. Chipmunk is a rigid body physics library in C designed for 2D games.
It's not a 1:1 port of the API, more of an OOP-Port. For instance <code>cpSpaceAddShape(space, foo)</code> in Chipmunk is <code>space.addShape(foo)</code> in Chipmunk.js.


h2. Status

Currently most of the API is ported. As far as I know off the top of my head the only gaps are in Constraints (pretty much nothing done) and Spatial Indexing (only SpatialHash available).

Since most of the code is similiar to the original C version there still is a lot of potential (and probably need) for optimizing it for Javascript.
Besides that there is still a lot of testing and cleanup to do so it's not recommend to use the lib in any bigger projects yet. 


h2. Requirements

Until now it only requires a AMD compatible scriptloader like requireJS or curl.js.
